# Python/Jupyter Challenge Questions
## Below are questions submitted (almost verbatim) to OpenAI's ChatGPT
1. **Stimulus:** Can you create a sample of a Jupyter notebook with python code that scans for the location of all existing openai chatGPT-based utilities or code on public GitHub or GitLab repositories, that also produces a summarized table in a Pandas dataframe, and that produces a visual heatmap of each project based on contributors?
    * **Response:** [chatgpt_git_scanner](https://github.com/land-fisher/chatgpt/blob/main/chatgpt_git_scanner.ipynb)
        * <u>Note:</u> the responses were manually captured in these custom named files and were originally provided on-screen
2. **Stimulus:** Can you produce a multi-stage Jupyter notebook of python code where the user can input the URL of a video, then the notebook leverages the OpenAI Whisper library to extract the audio and convert it to text.  Once the text output is produced, the Jupyter notebook will generate a word-cloud visual summarizing all of the words?
    * **Response:** [chatgpt_s2t_wordcloud](https://github.com/land-fisher/chatgpt/blob/main/chatgpt_s2t_wordcloud.ipynb)
